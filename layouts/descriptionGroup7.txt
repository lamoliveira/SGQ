the website allows the user to select a console and search a game
- the results displayed include the title, and any titles close to that one, ratings, and prices
- when a specific title is clicked, the next page includes a detailed description, game image, prices, and it also embeds twitch video/Youtube video of gameplay, and it also includes a more detailed review


rough breakdown of tasks:

1) create index to setup website.
- buttons
- modals

2) css to construct website how we want it to look.
- alternative library (materialize)

3) link igdb, twitch, and youtube API

4) format specific API info and append to index.
